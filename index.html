                            Derby-based Sinfonia Viva, the East Midlands’ only professional orchestra, is launching a new initiative to bring together local people who are carers for family and friends.                                                                                                                       The new Carers’ Choir will be open to people across Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire who will come together once a month to enjoy music and potentially have opportunities for performing.                                                                            The choir is  free to join. It will be led by award-winning choral conductor David Lawrence who will introduce a selection of choral favourites, songs from popular shows and pop favourites.
                            For more information, please contact Andrew Nesbitt at Sinfonia Viva, Tel: 01332 207602 or email <a href="mailTo:andrew@vivaorch.co.uk">andrew@vivaorch.co.uk</a>
