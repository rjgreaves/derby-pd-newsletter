                            Derby-based Sinfonia Viva, the East Midlands’ only professional orchestra, is launching a new initiative to bring together local people who are carers for family and friends.                                                                                                                       The new Carers’ Choir will be open to people across Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire who will come together once a month to enjoy music and potentially have opportunities for performing.                                                                            The choir is  free to join. It will be led by award-winning choral conductor David Lawrence who will introduce a selection of choral favourites, songs from popular shows and pop favourites.
                            For more information, please contact Andrew Nesbitt at Sinfonia Viva, Tel: 01332 207602 or email <a href="mailTo:andrew@vivaorch.co.uk">andrew@vivaorch.co.uk</a>

            In partnership with 64 Million Artists Derby Parkinson’s branch are offering a free creative project for anyone wanting to get involved.
            Creativity can help keep your mind active, improve your wellbeing and support you to make good connections with people. It’s also fun, easy to do, and something that can be designed around what you want to do or learn. This project will be part of an East Midlands wide initiative to get older people taking part in creative activities, and part of a national project to unlock the creativity in everyone.
            The group will meet weekly and be set different creative tasks and challenges to complete. These will always be fun, free to do and will involve lots of different kinds of things (drawing, writing, making, thinking, talking etc) so whatever you enjoy there will be something to suit you. We’ll also be encouraging you to learn from each other, and bring ideas to share. Throughout the week you can then (if you like) also pick up extra little challenges to do  at home or with friends or family, they will only take 10 or 15 mins and are completely optional, but they’re a way of practising your creativity throughout the week. We’ll be encouraging groups to also post about what they’ve been doing on the projects website, to share with friends and family or the wider world ,if they want to.

            Although the project is being offered to the Parkinson’s group - it is open to anyone so if you’d like to bring friends or family members along too that’s fine. The sessions will be taking place weekly on
            <em>Mondays from 10.30 -12pm in the Aston Court Hotel</em>. The first session is <em>15 May</em>.

                            The future of Attendance Allowance – a lifeline for people living with Parkinson’s – has been saved thanks to Parkinson’s UK campaigners in England.
                            Result! Phil Reynolds, our Policy and Campaigns Adviser, explains “We sent our response to the consultation before Christmas. We met the minister in January to list our concerns. On 19 January, we found out Attendance Allowance would continue to be managed by central government.”
