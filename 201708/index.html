                    It wasn’t a sunny day-in fact it was quite grey and overcast, threatening rain at any time. In or out? The decision was made for out, even though the tombola tickets threatened to blow across Uttoxeter Road!

                    However, this proved to be a good day for a garden party -stalls and gazeboes were erected and the garden was bedecked with flags, bunting and balloons.
                    Thank you to all who came to help in some way. Thanks are also due to those who gave prizes and manned “or womanned” stalls, or made some of the endless yummy cakes!
                    The final THANK YOU, and the most important, is for Liz and Brian. Without the kind offer of the use of their lovely house and beautiful garden, there would not have been a Garden Party this year…. and Parkinson’s Funds would be down by £511.  Yes, £511 an amazing total – and a very happy afternoon!

            <h3>Bye Bye Beard</h3>
            <p>
                My beard often made me (and others) laugh. It was really long. If it was windy, it would divide in the middle and keep my ears warm. If I had a Sunday lunch, I had to be very careful. Once I leant over too far and ended up with gravy on the ends of it!  Playing the piano accordion hurt, when my beard got stuck in the bellows ( I had to put it inside my tee shirt!)
                Anyway, My wife Barbara and I had had a natter about it, whether to get rid of it or not,  then whilst we were at the Hydro Therapy pool I heard a voice……..  ‘Phil's having his beard shaved off in aid of Parkinson's'.’  …and that was the beginning of it. Three weeks later we went to The Flowerpot, where it was to take place. (Now in three weeks you have a lot conversations, yet nothing else was happening. No cutting. No trimming) Then at 8.15pm on the 20​ ​June I went into the back room of The Flowerpot, and in front of family, friends and complete strangers (curious to see this thing that was happening), I sat down on a chair. A bobble was put on said beard, and……SNIP!  It then became real. This was happening! Now! Three quarters of an hour later, after a lot of laughing and joking, snipping and shaving, with loads of photographs and videos, it was all off. It felt so strange, as I hadn't seen my chin for 20 years.  Now, I am getting a bit more at ease with it, and also the new thing of SHAVING!
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re still amazed at  the amount it raised. At the moment this stands at ​£583.80,​. I would like to say a big​ <em>THANKYOU</em>​ to everyone who contributed, including ‘our’ Stace doing her first public shave.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier this year I missed the Parkinson’s walk. I now feel I have done something instead  to make up for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The question now is………..What about my pony tail????

            <p>
                Comments from those who came to the Cycle Derby  sessions this summer  ranged from ‘’Very enjoyable’’ to ‘’ Felt very tired afterwards’’. Some people felt their knees took the stress, but joining with Ashbourne Branch  was very sociable.  Cycle Derby also ran 3 weekly sessions with a trainer, which we could take part in. There was separate funding for these sessions , which several people took advantage of . Thanks to Ann Butler (and Christine from  Cycle Derby), who  have arranged another session -Wednesday 13 September 10.30am -12 noon Markeaton Park (McDonald’s car park end of the park . again some folk from  Ashbourne hope to join us, so it should be another time to socialise, as well as have some exercise. As you may remember ,a wide range of bikes, tandems and adapted cycles are available. So if you haven’t had a go so far ….on your bike.
